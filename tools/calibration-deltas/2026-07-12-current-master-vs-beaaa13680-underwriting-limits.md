# BEAAA-13680 Golden N=5 Release Gate

- Contract: `are-scanner-api-v1@v1.0`
- Baseline: `current-master`
- Candidate: `beaaa13680-underwriting-limits`
- Release-gate corpus version: `0.2.0`
- Claim: `8/9 baselined`
- Full roster: `G1, G2, G3, M1, M2, M3, B1, B2, B3`
- Roster: `G1, G2, G3, M1, M2, M3, B1, B3`
- Excluded: `B2: BEAAA-10199 v1-only decision: approved target model returned 404 through the approved provider path before score output; prior 55/C- dry-run evidence is retained as historical evidence and is not promoted as a known-bad baseline.`
- Seeds: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`
- Variance gate: `total and each pillar spread <= 1.0`
- Drift gate: `absolute median delta for total and each pillar <= 1.0`
- Result: `BLOCK`
- Single-turn spread result: `PASS`
- Single-turn delta result: `BLOCK`

Release wording: BackBond Scanner v1 engine release ran on 8/9 baselined golden fixtures. B2 is explicitly excluded from the v1 gate because its approved target model returned 404 through the approved provider path before score output. The prior B2 dry-run score, 55/C-, is retained as historical evidence and is not promoted as a known-bad golden baseline.
