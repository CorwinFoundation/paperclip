"""are-scanner runner adapters.

`promptfoo_runner` wraps the Promptfoo CLI as the canonical eval-framework
runner driving Path A (OpenRouter base-model proxy scans) and Path B
(customer-deployment harness). Garak / HarmBench / PromptBench are probe
sources executed via Promptfoo, NOT separate runners — see BEAAA-105 /
BEAAA-106.
